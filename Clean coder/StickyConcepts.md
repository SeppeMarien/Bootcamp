# Clean coder

## Chapter 1: professionalism

### Responsibility

 Taking responsibility is one of the greatest things a software developer needs to learn. It is better is to admit that you didn't work as fast as you should and by that that you can't commit your work. Because the only alternative is that you skip important pieces: testing, refactoring, "clean coding", ...

### Work ethic --> know your field

` Remember Santayana's curse: "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.`

Your carrier is your own responsibility, you need to make sure that you progress even if your employer doesn't help you with it. If your employer gives you the time and resources to progress then see it as a privilege. You also need to make sure you know about the past even if it are concepts that aren't being used anymore. Knowing where things failed or what the positive and negative sides of programs and concepts are makes it easier to prevent making the same mistakes.
-- kKeep learning is the key!

### Work ethic --> Humility

`So when a professional finds himself the butt of a joke, he'll be the first to laugh. He will never ridicule others, but will accept ridicule when it's deserved and laugh it off when it's not.`

While a professional know it's field and can create beautiful and amazing programs out of nothing it is likely that he will make a mistake. This mistake can be something stupid or something big but he'll never get mad about it. It's best to "suck it up" when they make a joke about it even if it's not deserved.

## Saying no

### Being a "Team Player"

`A team player is not someone who says yes all the time.`

Being a team player is not only being funny, being part of the group or even taking so much work on you so you can deliver. A team player also can say "no" when he or she have to. Everyone has a limit even you so you can only say yes when it is possible for you and the team!

### High stakes

`The higher the stakes, the more valuable no becomes.`

The moments that people start saying that something has to be finished is often the moment that the stakes are high, but at these moments it is your duty to say no if it isn't possible. If you say yes at moments like these and you can deliver then the result will be more severe.

### Passive aggression

`When a freight train is bearing down on you and you are the only one who can see it, you can either step quietly off the track and watch everyone else et run over, or you can yell "Train! Get off the track!"`

The moment someone tries to push you to deliver and you know that it isn't possible you have to say no, but the moment they still keep pushing and don't want to believe that it isn't possible you need to take action. The best way to do this is combining passive aggression with with full blown action. Make sure that you have prove that you and your team (Remember that you are a team player) said that it isn't possible but if it is your team lead or manager that is pushing you try to push him or her to tell their superior that it isn't possible. 

## Saying yes

### A language of commitment --> recognizing lack of commitment

`As you start to look for these words you'll see that you start spotting them almost everywhere around you, and even in things you say to others.`

Even in our everyday conversations it happens way to quickly that we say to try something or do something without meaning it. The best way to stop doing this is by recognizing noncommitment in not only what other people say but also in what you say. The moment you recognize how much we do this is the moment you can start working on preventing this.

### A language of commitment --> What does commitment sounds like

`The secret ingredient to recognize real commitment is to look for sentences that sounds like this: "I will ... by ..."`

"I will try", this is not commitment even if you just told someone that the odds are small you cannot just say that you will try. You need to say that you will do something (where the something is clearly specified) and until what time you want to finish it. By doing this you promise that it will get done. 

### Learning how to say yes --> committing with discipline 

When someone is trying to push you in delivering sooner is and you know it might be possible then you can't overthrow your discipline as a professional to be 100% sure to deliver when asked. You can't deliver without tests, you can't commit without refactoring, ... It is never a good idee to leave out tasks even if they don't have immediate impact on the functionality.
